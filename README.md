# Portfolio Website for Casey Pitman

My portfolio displays several of my work samples, both website projects and JavaScript web app projects.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- JavaScript
- JQuery

## Notes

- Like most developers I am constantly upgrading my portfolio site as I learn new skills. This is the third version of my portfolio and while I'm fond of it, I'm thinking it's time for an upgrade to [React](https://reactjs.org/).

- I'm quite proud of the typewriting animation that appears after loading, though looking back now it feels a bit over-engineered. I'll probably take a run at a refactor when I shift to React.

- Handling for the contact form runs through [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). However, I'm beginning to learn Node.js and will most likely set up my own back end to handle forms in the future.
